## What are xrRNAs?

RNAs are essential biomolecules involved in many cellular processes, including gene expression and regulation. However, their instability and susceptibility to degradation by exoribonucleases pose a challenge for their use as therapeutic agents or as tools for molecular and synthetic biology research.

**Exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs)** are a class of structured RNAs that are resistant to degradation by cellular enzymes known as exoribonucleases. They can efficiently halt exoribonucleases, such as XRN1, and prevent degradation of downstream RNA. This unique property makes xrRNAs an attractive target for a wide range of research applications, from studying the basic mechanisms of RNA biology to developing new RNA therapeutics.
